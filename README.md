# Phonepe-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration-project

The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:

1. Data Extraction:
Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

2. Data Transformation:
Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

3. Database Insertion:
Storing transformed data in a POSTGRESQL database.

4. Dashboard Creation:
Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

5. Data Retrieval:
Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.

6. Deployment:
Thorough testing before deploying the dashboard for public access. The outcome is a live geo visualization dashboard presenting insights from the data, enhancing skills in coding, data handling, visualization, and deployment. The project showcases proficiency in these areas, providing practical learning experiences.

LIBRARIES NEEDED:
Python: The core programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
Git: Version control system for cloning and managing the GitHub repository.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for cleaning, transforming, and structuring data.
Postgresql: A library to connect and interact with SQL databases.
Streamlit: A Python library for creating interactive web applications for data visualization.
Plotly: A library for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations, including geo maps.
Web Browser: To access and interact with the created dashboard.
GitHub: For hosting the project's code repository.
Code Editor/IDE: An integrated development environment to write and manage the code.
